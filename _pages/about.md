I am an experienced electronics engineer with over 12 years of expertise in the military industry, specializing in Avionics Maintenance and Quality Control. I hold a PhD in Computer Vision (2023) from the [Department of Computer Engineering & Informatics](https://www.ceid.upatras.gr/en) at University of Patras. I received my M.Sc. degree from the same Department in 2017 and my B.Sc. degree from the [Hellenic Airforce Academy](https://hafa.haf.gr/en/) in 2013. I am passionate about driving innovation and advancing technology, focusing on developing intelligent vision algorithms and pioneering cutting-edge solutions.
