I am currently a PhD Student at the [Department of Computer Engineering & Informatics](https://www.ceid.upatras.gr/en) at University of Patras. I received my M.Sc. degree from the same Department in 2017 and my B.Sc. degree from the Hellenic Airforce Academy in 2013. My curent research focuses on computer vision, machine learning and their applications to human-computer interaction. Specifically, I am working on eye tracking and gaze estimation with a single webcam.
